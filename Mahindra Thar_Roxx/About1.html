        </div>

         <h2>The Mahindra Thar has been an iconic car since the time the car was born. The Mahindra Thar Roxx represents a notable evolution in the Thar lineup, catering to both urban drivers and adventure enthusiasts who want more than a typical off-road vehicle. Introduced as a five-door variant, the Roxx expands on the classic three-door Thar by adding significant interior space, a longer wheelbase, and a range of comfort-oriented features. This design shift accommodates families and those seeking a more practical, daily-use SUV without sacrificing the rugged DNA that makes the Thar popular among off-roaders.</h2>

            <h3>The First Thar</h3>
            <p>This led to the new generation of cars called the Thar as it is known today. This car got a new design from the other cars. The rebranding worked in favour of the company and it sold in good numbers. There was only one competition to this vehicle and it was the Maruti Gypsy. The Maruti Gypsy had only one advantage that the it had a petrol engine option whereas the Mahindra Thar was available only as a diesel car. In 2015, the car was improved for safety and it was given better offroad hardware. This continued till 2019 when the company introduced the Thar 700 edition.  </p>
